# FHIR4Java Agents

The project is to demonstrate the amazing capabilities of HL7 FHIR and AI. It will first use AI to generate the implementation plan which will implement a configuration driven FHIR services to support both HL7 FHIR defined resources and project defined custom resources.

It will also contain a set of SKILLS to allow project team to define new API for existing resources, and define new resources without any manual coding required.
